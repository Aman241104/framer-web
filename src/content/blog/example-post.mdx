# Stop Working IN Your Business

If you want to scale past $10k/month, you can't rely on raw hustle anymore. You need **systems**.

> "Systems are the bridge between your current reality and your ultimate vision."

## 1. Document Everything
Before you can automate, you must document. Every process in your business should be written down step-by-step.

### The Power of SOPs
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) allow you to delegate tasks to team members or AI agents with confidence. If you don't have an SOP, you don't have a system.

## 2. Automate the Repetitive Tasks
We use tools like Zapier, Make, and custom AI scripts to handle the heavy lifting.

```javascript
// Example: Sending new leads to Slack
const sendToSlack = async (lead) => {
  await fetch(SLACK_WEBHOOK, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: `🚀 New Lead: ${lead.name} (${lead.email})`
    })
  });
}
```

## 3. Scale with Clarity
Once your systems are in place, growth becomes a math problem, not a hustle problem. You can confidently spend more on marketing because you know the backend can handle it.
